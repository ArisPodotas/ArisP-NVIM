# Introduction

KSwitch is a Neovim plugin that handles different remap configuration files and allows for switching between configurations with keybinds essentially multiplying the ammount of keybinds.

KSwitch creates copies of your remap file with small alterations so that upon entering a keybind specific keystrokes change into different command.

### Keymap switching

-- Make a remap for loading a different nvim remap.lua file so that the same keymaps have multiple outputs
