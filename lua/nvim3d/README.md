# Introduction

nvim3D is a Neovim plugin that handles different remap configuration files and allows for switching between configurations with keybinds essentially multiplying the ammount of keybinds, or keyboard in a sence. Hence the 3d name because it's as if there are multiple keyboards placed one ontop of the other in a vertical way.

nvim3D creates copies of your remap file with small alterations so that upon entering a keybind specific keystrokes change into different command. The same keystrokes can be used for different outcomes so now you won't need to look thorugh your configuration to find a binding you havent used already and you won't need to learn new keybinds for utility you want to add to your config.

### Keymap switching

-- Make a remap for loading a different nvim remap.lua file so that the same keymaps have multiple outputs
