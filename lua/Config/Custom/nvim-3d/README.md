# Introduction

nvim3D is a Neovim plugin that handles different remap configuration files and allows for switching between configurations with keybinds essentially multiplying the amount of keybinds, or keyboard in a since. Hence the 3d name because it's as if there are multiple keyboards placed one on top of the other in a vertical way. This is essentially a way to form new modes though you won't see unique names to the modes come up in the relative area of the status bar at the bottom.

nvim3D creates copies of your remap file with small alterations so that upon entering a keybind specific keystrokes change into different command. The same keystrokes can be used for different outcomes so now you won't need to look through your configuration to find a binding you haven't used already and you won't need to learn new keybinds for utility you want to add to your config.

### Keymap switching

-- Make a remap for loading a different nvim remap.lua file so that the same keymaps have multiple outputs
