# Introduction

This repository contains my local neovim config. I'm on a windows 11 laptop (now also on a linux laptop that you can check that branch for) and I made all the config off of kickstart.nvim (), building slowly while my preferences change (you wont find too many traces of kickstart here anymore).

# Contributing? 

I guess you can fork this repo but for what purpose?
