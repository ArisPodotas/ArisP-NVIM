# Introduction

This repository contains my locla neovim config. I'm on a windows 11 laptop and I made all the config off of kickstart.nvim (), building slowly while my preferences change.

# Contributing? 

I guess you can fork this repo but for what purpose.

# Todo

- [ ] Remove the firendly snippets already builting to the kickstart.nvim files and write your own snippets from here on
- [ ] Find how to do advanced treesitter text objects and things like go to next ""
- [ ] Edit the plugins by making a different branch for them in git so that mason does not bug my ass about not being able to pull
