# Introduction

This repository contains my local neovim config. I'm on a windows 11 laptop (now also on a linux laptop that you can check that branch for) and I made all the config off of kickstart.nvim (), building slowly while my preferences change (you wont find too many traces of kickstart here anymore).

# Contributing? 

I guess you can fork this repo but for what purpose?

# Todo

- [ ] Remove the firendly snippets already builtin to the kickstart.nvim files and write your own snippets from here on (move them to ftplugins)
- [ ] Find how to do advanced treesitter text objects and things like go to next ""
- [ x ] Make a file sourcing keybind setup
- [ x ] Split files into separate folders and sub files for all the config
# Stats

This sections is to have a few tracking changes of startup time

Pre ftplugin snippet moving (I moved all the snippets of ftplugins to not source on init)
